# waveform-generator
Final Waveform Generator Project for my UW Microprocessor System Design course which runs a simple amplitude-adjustable, frequency-adjustable waveform generator.

Assembles, tests, and programs a TIVA TM4C123GXL Launchpad Microcontroller attached to a lab-specific PCB and 4x4 Keypad to run said waveform generator.
